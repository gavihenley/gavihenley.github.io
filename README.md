My GitHub account is "gavihenley.github.io" my first and last name. 

This is my first repository, but I plan to upload code here.

Well first I logged into GitHub and then I created a New repository. After that I named it and made sure I enabled a ReadMe file then downloaded the application to my laptop. After I did that I loaded in and it asked if I wanted to clone a repository and I clicked this one.

### **About Me**
#### **My Hobbies** 
* Hanging out with my friends.
 I am always with some friends, whether it's going downtown with Eric, or playing 2k with Brody, Evan, Tanner, and Joey.
* Listening to music. 
 I listen to music all the time, this isn't an exaggeration. I listen to music when I am driving somewhere, playing the game, showering, even sleeping.
* Working out.
 I have been working out for a few months and it has been the best thing. It helps you deal with built up stress and it's just so calming.
* Gaming.
 I play games such as _League of Legends_, _Valorant_, _NBA 2K_, and a lot more.

### **Spotify links to some of my favorite music artists** 
* [**Beabadoobee**](https://open.spotify.com/artist/35l9BRT7MXmM8bv2WDQiyB?si=WJiKVSSTRQufzR3-k35Y7A)
 I love Beabadoobee because her music is so calming and she is really good at singing, her voice is simply beautiful.

* [**Wave To Earth**](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5069JTmv5ZDyPeZaCCXiCg?si=ajSqN_9tSXeezH66gpXprw)

 I'm actually going to their concert in New York on November 2nd. I am really excited, they're my favorite asian band as of right now.
* [**Travis Scott**](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0Y5tJX1MQlPlqiwlOH1tJY?si=NROqlKB7Rp2UnydrA57MTw)
 Travis Scott has made a huge impact on my life. His music helps me get hype for when I need it. I personally believe he was robbed of a grammy on numerous occasions. 

* [**Dominic Fike**](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6USv9qhCn6zfxlBQIYJ9qs?si=4EBRfiUaSG-mHJSqY1VyTA)
 Dominic Fike always makes music that puts me in that summer mood. Whenever I listen to him I can just imagine a beach, the sound of waves crashing against the sand, and a nice summer breeze. 

* [**Babytron**](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0sKsReKseslDlhxmbN6wLk?si=Zzb-NUCxRsGmykX-B5tXsA)
 Babytron isn't mentioned enough as I think he should be. He brings so much energy to me when I listen to him. His word play is criminally underrated and I think he should have more listeners.
