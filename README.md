My GitHub account is "gavihenley.github.io" my first and last name. 

This is my first repository, but I plan to upload code here.

Well first I logged into GitHub and then I created a New repository. After that I named it and made sure I enabled a ReadMe file then downloaded the application to my laptop. After I did that I loaded in and it asked if I wanted to clone a repository and I clicked this one.
